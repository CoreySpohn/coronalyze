"""Calibration tools for detection statistics (experimental).

Three pieces that turn a statistic map into a calibrated detection claim:

- candidates: local maxima of a statistic map (find_candidates).
- null: how many independent trials a search covers and how many false alarms
  a calibrated statistic may produce (n_resolution_elements, false_alarm_band).
- injection: throughput statistics from injection-recovery records and the
  contrast curve they imply (throughput_profile, contrast_curve).

These are host-side post-run helpers on NumPy arrays; none is jit-compiled.
To calibrate a statistic map against reference apertures on the same ring,
use MapFilter with DetectionEstimator.
