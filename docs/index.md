# Welcome to coronablink Documentation

**coronablink** is a JAX-based library for post-processing coronagraphic direct imaging data. It provides SNR calculation, aperture photometry, and yield simulation pipelines.

*The name references the [blink comparator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_comparator), the instrument used to discover Pluto by quickly switching between photographic plates.*
